# Data Visualization and Interactive Data Visualization Project

This repository contains two Jupyter Notebooks demonstrating key concepts and applications in data visualization using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly Express.

## 📁 Files

- `project2.ipynb`  
  📊 *Data Visualization Notebook*  
  This notebook includes various types of static visualizations using:
  - Pandas
  - Matplotlib 
  It covers:
  - Bar plots
  - Pie charts
  - Box plots
  - Histograms
  - Scatter plots
  - Line graphs  
  These plots are helpful for EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) and reporting insights from datasets.

- `Project2_part2.ipynb`  
  🎯 *Interactive Data Visualization Notebook*  
  This notebook builds upon the static plots and introduces interactivity using:
  - Plotly Express
  - Plotly Graph Objects  
  It includes:
  - Interactive bar charts
  - Hover-enabled scatter plots
  - Time-series visualizations
  - Interactive layout customizations  

## 📌 Objectives

- Demonstrate different methods of visualizing data effectively.
- Highlight the difference between static and interactive plots.
- Make data exploration intuitive and visually insightful.

## 🛠️ Requirements

Install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn plotly
